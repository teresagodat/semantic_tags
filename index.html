          <h1>A Boy and His Dogs</h1>
          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
              <p>
                  The dogs were 4 years old when Jamieson was brought home from the hospital.  Everyone asked if we were going to get rid of our dogs when the baby was born. NO! The dogs are family. People would say, "Aren't you worried that those <em>pit bulls</em> will hurt the baby?" Absolutely not!</p>

              <p>
                  The bonding between our big loveable pit bulls and our baby started from day one. &hearts;</p>

          <h3>Fun Times Together</h3>
              <p>
                  Over the years, Jamieson and our two pitties have become quite the trio. Lulu, our brown and white pittie, is very gentle and protective of Jamieson. Lucky, the black and white pittie, is very playful. Both dogs <em>LOVE</em> to give pittie kisses! Jamieson calls Lulu his, "Pretty Pittie". It is quite adorable.</p>

          <h3>The Love between a Boy and His Dogs:</h3>
            <p> 
                It has always been said that a dog is a man's best friend. This is true. A dog is loyal and is always by your side.
